This is my first Application for Android that I have done during an Android Study Jam in Berlin (made by Woman Techmakers Berlin).

Basics for this App were given at Udacity lesson 2A and 2B. I have extended some finctionality and added a design.
 
The quantity does not go under zero, I have a simple spinner with items from array, that I created in strings.xml.
